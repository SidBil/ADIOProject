# Image Prompts for Speech Data Collection

These prompts are designed to guide autistic speakers in creating descriptive utterances about visual scenes. Each prompt corresponds to an image and is structured to elicit natural, detailed verbal descriptions.

The utterances collected from speakers using these prompts will be used to fine-tune the ASR model, enabling it to better recognize and transcribe disordered speech patterns commonly found in the autistic community.
